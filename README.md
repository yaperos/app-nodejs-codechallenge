# Yape Code Challenge :rocket:

In this project solution you'll find two independent microservices, each with its own contents as if they were on different repos. In order to appropriately test this solution you must access each MS and follow the initalization instructions on the 'Getting started' sections found on the README files.

## NOTES:
> To test the whole project you can run the docker-compose file in the transaction-api microservice (it contains all service requirements) so you can skip that step on the other MS.
> Open one terminal and run the transaction-api project, then open another terminal and run the anti-fraud-ms project.
> Verify that zookeeper and kafka have fully initiated otherwise you might see kafka errors.
